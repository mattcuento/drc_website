# drc_website

A website intended to revamp the transportation system used by Cal Poly's Disability Resource Center. This web application was designed for students, drivers, and admin to be able to schedule rides, be routed, and oversee all users with ease.

The project was unfortunately scrapped due to conflicts with Cal Poly's software policies. The unfinished site is visible [here](https://drc-tram.firebaseapp.com) without authentication to be able to view the three areas.

A team of 4 coders comprised of computer science and software engineering majors contributed to this project together.
