# drc_website

A website intended to revamp the transportation system used by Cal Poly's Disability Resource Center. This web application was designed for students, drivers, and admin to be able to schedule rides, be routed, and oversee all users with ease.

The project was unfortunately scrapped due to conflicts with Cal Poly's software policies. The unfinished site is visible [here](https://john-lee-site.web.app/). Some areas may still have authentication in place.

A team of 4 coders comprised of computer science and software engineering majors contributed to this project together.

## Technologies Used

We used Angular, vanilla JS, and Bootstrap for our front-end. To accompany this, we utilized Firebase/Javascript for our backend for ease of use.
